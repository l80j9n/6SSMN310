Assessment 2 –   Individual Coursework
(75% of total module grade)
The Task
In this assignment, you will   have the   unique opportunity to engage with the   Family   Business Simulation:   Honey   Heritage twice during the term. Your task   involves   playing through the simulation at   both the   beginning and end of the course. While   participating, it's   important to   approach the   decisions   as   if you   were   running a   real family   business, emphasizing authenticity over what   may seem   "correct." This   experiential   learning exercise will allow you to   navigate the complexities of multi-generational   family businesses and observe   how your choices evolve as you   progress through the course. Through   self-reflection, you will gain valuable   insights into family,   business, and ownership dynamics,   enhancing your   understanding of this intricate field.
Period to take the simulation for the first time: 22 January to 5   February (extended from January   29).
Note:   Use this   handout to   record and justify your decisions. You will submit this   handout with the   individual   coursework on April   19   (as an appendix).
Period to take the simulation for the second time:   18   March to   15 April.

Assignment   Details and Structure:   Family Business Simulation Self-Reflection
I.   Introduction (around 300 words)
•          Provide   an overview   of the   assignment's   objectives   and   the   importance   of   self-reflection   in   understanding family   business dynamics.
•          Briefly   describe   and compare   your   overall   experiences   during   the   first   and   the   second   round   of the   Honey   Heritage simulation.
•            Briefly describe the structure of   the essay.
II. Analysis of simulation decisions (around 1200-1400 words)
•          Describe   and compare   your   decisions   during   the   first   and   the代 写6SSMN310 – Entrepreneurial Family Firms Assessment 2C/C++
代做程序编程语言   second   round   of the   Honey   Heritage   simulation,   reflecting on   how stakeholders' opinions and family   members'   perspectives shaped your decisions throughout the simulation.
•          Apply a minimum of   2   theoretical   frameworks   studied   in the   module   to   discuss   any   changes   or   adjustments you   made   in your decision-making. Where decisions   have   not   been changed or   adjusted, explain   how these theoretical frameworks   helped you   understand and interpret your   simulation experience.
•          Incorporate   relevant   insights from guest   lectures,   experiences from   outside the   classroom,   or   use   examples of family firms studied in class and   beyond   (e.g., your   own family firm) to   complement explanations of your decisions.
This   middle   part of the essay can   be structured in   several   different   ways,   e.g.,   by first   and   second   round   of   taking the simulation;   by generation;   by   key decisions, etc. You do   not   need to coverall the   simulation   decisions—feel free to concentrate on the   most significant decisions, or the   decisions that   had   most   significant shifts from the first to the second   round.
III. Conclusion (around 300-500 words)
•          Summarize the   main   lessons and   insights gained from the   simulation   and the   self-reflection   process.
•          Highlight   any   challenges   or   dilemmas you   encountered   across the family,   business,   and   ownership   dimensions, and   how you addressed them.
•          Reflect   on   how this   experience   has   prepared you for future   roles   or   challenges   in   family-run   businesses.
IV.   References
Cite any   references or course   materials   used in yourself-reflection (Harvard   style).
V. Appendix (if   needed)Include any additional information, charts, or diagrams   that   support   yourself-reflection,   such   as   decision   trees or stakeholder feedback summaries, as well as the   handout where you   recorded your   decisions for      the first time you took the simulation.
