6SSMN310 – Entrepreneurial Family Firms 
Assessment 1 – Groupwork 
(25% of total module grade)
The Task In this groupwork, you will develop a   pitch deck   describing a   social   intrapreneurial   opportunity for   a   family   firm of your choice. A social intrapreneurial opportunity   represents the   potential to   introduce   an   innovative   social   initiative   (focused on social and/or environmental value creation) within   an   established   organization.
Group Composition and   Documentation: 4-5 students, allocated   by   module team, and   based on tutorial groups. Once groups are formed, you are required to complete a Group Learning Agreement and submit it via KEATS by February 16. When you submit your pitch deck, you are also required to submit a Group Work Log and Peer Evaluation document, as well as an Individual Evaluation document via KEATS. 
Choosing a family firm:    You are welcome to act as “consultants” for the   family   firm   of   a   group   member   (if   all   members agree), or a family firm you   have access to.   You   can   choose   a   family   firm   of   any   size   (examples   of   large family firms can   be found in the Global Family Business Index).   Each   group   in   each tutorial   class
should work with a different family firm   (for example, we   cannot   have   two   groups   in   the   same   class   working with   LVMH).
Module Learning Outcomes Assessed 
2.         Apply   theories   from   psychology,   sociology,   economics   and   strategy   to   key   questions   in
family   firms.
3.          Identify   and   explain   the   critical   role   of   entrepreneurship   in   the   founding   of   family   firms   and
innovation   in   their   sustainability.
Assignment Details and Structure 
Pitch   Deck Structure (1o-12 slides + references slides and   PAIR framework   appendices)

.             Brief explanation of a specific   social/environmental   problem,   need,   or   injustice.
.             Evidence of   unmet demand,   market failure,   or   insufficient   provision for the   identified   issue.
.             Explanation of why the   issue   presents an   opportunity   relevant to the   family firm,   applying   theory.
Entrepreneurial solution (around   4-5 slides)
.             Description of the solution to address   the   identified   issue   within   the   family   firm.

.             Examination of the   resources   required for the   initiative   (financial,   human, etc.),   and   discussion of   the family firm’s capacity to   mobilize and allocate   required   resources,   applying theory.
Conclusion (1 slide)
.             Recap of the   initiative’s significance to the family   firm   and   potential   impact   on   positive   social   change.

Use of AI: PAIR framework 
In this group assignment, we will   integrate the   PAIR   (Problem AI   Interaction   Reflection) framework:
1.   Problem   Formulation   |   Before engaging with AI:   Identify a   family firm for which you will   propose a
social   intrapreneurial   initiative. Conduct   research to   better   understand the family firm's   history, values,
market   position, and the current approach to social value   creation.   Based   on this   research,   clearly   delineate   gaps or challenges   in social value creation.   Identify a   social   or   environmental   issue   for   your   proposal.
Conduct secondary   research to   better   understand the   issue. Consider different angles of the   problem   and   understand   its scope and   relevance to the family firm.
2. AITool Selection   |   For   Research and Solution   Development:   Research AI tools   relevant to
entrepreneurship and your specific objectives.   Evaluate and select   the   most   suitable   AI   tools   for your
problem, considering their features, functions,   potential   benefits, and   limitations. Tools   like ChatGPT,
Google   Bard, or Claude   2 can   provide   insights, generate   ideas, or   even   help   structure the   pitch   deck.   Record   your findings   in a table, documenting the tools you’ve explored and   chosen   or   discarded,   accompanied   by   brief   justifications for your choices   (Appendix 1   for submission).
3.   Interaction   |   During the   Development of Entrepreneurial Solutions:   Engage with your chosen AI tools   to   refine your solutions and articulate the   potential impact   on the family   firm. This   involves   experimenting   with different   inputs and critically evaluating the outputs.   Use AI   tools for   brainstorming,   refining   ideas,   and   assessing the feasibility of   proposed solutions.   Maintain a   record of your   interactions with AI,   noting successful   prompts and areas where AI   may   have   limitations or   biases   (Appendix 2   for submission).
4.   Reflection   |   Post-Assignment: Compose a short   reflective   report   (3oo words   max.)   in which you   ponder      over the   lessons   learned from your   problem-solving   process with the AI tools,   how you can improve your   skills and future application of AI in   entrepreneurship,   and your feelings   while   using   these   tools   (Appendix 3   for submission).
